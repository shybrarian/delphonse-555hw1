<h1>Third Criterion: Flexibility and efficiency of use</h1>
<p><i>"Accelerators — unseen by the novice user — may often speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the system can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions."</i></p>

<h2><span style="color:green">O </span>NGA</h2> <p>There is a small pin icon by each record on the search results page as well as on the record webpage. Users can save records for the duration of their session. Email, permalink, and other actions are also available. These functions benefit the casual researcher as well as the more experienced user.</p>
<br>

<h2><span style="color:green">O </span>Met</h2> <p>A novice to this catalog can use the standard search settings for a simple, Google-like search. More advanced users can limit the search before they even view the first results, by Keyword/Title/Subject... options and also by library collection.</p>
<br>

<h2> <span style="color:red">X </span>Getty</h2> <p>This catalog does not look appealing – especially with its complex refinements list – and this makes it difficult for any user to navigate. The Ringling catalog has a similar problem. There is a Basket function to save records for the duration of a session, but the button to add records to the basket is difficult to find. It is a tiny star to the left of the item title for every record. It took me a couple of minutes to figure it out.</p>
<br>

<h2> <span style="color:red">X </span>Ringling</h2> <p>Not unlike the Getty catalog, the Ringling catalog is not very easy on the eyes. Using the catalog is difficult for users at any level. Experienced users can refer to the handy list of outside resources like WorldCat and GoogleBooks to complement their search.</p>
<br>

<h2> <span style="color:red">X </span>MFA</h2> <p>This catalog is by far the most clunky and unfriendly. There are not many functions, so not a lot of perks for more experienced users. </p>
