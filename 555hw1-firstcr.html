<h1>First Criterion: Match between system and the real world</h1>
<p><i>"The system should speak the users' language, with words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than system-oriented terms. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order."</i></p>

<h2><span style="color:green">O </span>NGA</h2> <p>The search refinements in this catalog are particularly nice since they are numerous and in clear understandable language.
 These refinements include Sort by, Show Only, Format, Author/Creator, Date, Language, Subject. Department, Location, and Genre.
 There are arrows next to each of these options – a down arrow to signify that the user can expand the list and an up arrow to collapse a list.
 This interface looks like a newer version of the Getty’s catalog, with more CSS.</p>

<h2> <span style="color:red">X </span>Met</h2> <p>The condensed records shown in the search results include helpful information like location information and format, as well as a Request function for immediate use. However, the user must go back to the main search page whenever they wish to refine a search. This means lots of hitting the back button and forgetting search queries. <a href="555hw1-screenshots.html">(See Screenshot)</a></p>

<h2><span style="color:green">O </span>Getty</h2> <p>There are many search refinements on the left panel of this clunky but functional catalog. There are up and down arrows next to the options that allow the user to expand and collapse lists. This interface looks like an older version of NGA’s catalog, with more HTML.</p>
<br>

<h2> <span style="color:red">X </span>Ringling</h2> <p>The library collection is listed in the catalog of Florida State University (FSU). When the link from the library webpage takes the user to the FSU page, it is kind of jarring to see the university name and colors instead of the subdued grey tones of the museum website. And, because of this hosting situation, the user must make a point to limit the search results to Ringling Museum or else they will accidentally search the entire FSU collection. <a href="555hw1-screenshots.html">(See Screenshot)</a></p>

<h2> <span style="color:red">X </span>MFA</h2> <p>This library collection is listed through the Fenway Library Organization, so it is jarring to transfer to a catalog page that doesn’t have the museum name or logo up front. Users must make sure to specify the search as Museum of Fine Arts. There is some systems language used to denote refinements; for instance, after limiting the search to Musuem of Fine Arts, the phrase “LOCA = Museum of Fine Arts” showed up under the query phase. This might be confusing to some users. <a href="555hw1-screenshots.html">(See Screenshot)</a></p>
