<h1>Second Criterion: User control and freedom</h1>
<p><i>"Users often choose system functions by mistake and will need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted state without having to go through an extended dialogue. Support undo and redo."</i></p>

<h2><span style="color:green">O </span>NGA</h2> <p>When the user clicks on a record in the search results, it shows up in an overlay screen. It is easy to exit this screen because there is a big X to the left of the record, and ‘underneath’ the overlay the previous search results screen is still visible. Similarly, any external links open in a new tab, so the user is always only one quick away from the previous screen view or tab.<a href="555hw1-screenshots.html">(See Screenshot)</a> </p>
<br>

<h2> <span style="color:red">X </span>Met</h2> <p>Records open on a new webpage, but within records, the user can click Next record or Previous record on the top right of the page to toggle through the search results list. However, the user must click the back button in order to return to the original search results page. This process could be tedious and confusing if the user has scrolled through many records. Thankfully, they can view search history if they get frustrated and click on the main search rather than hit the back button until they return to the results page.</p>
<br>

<h2><span style="color:green">O </span>Getty</h2> <p>When you view a record in this catalog, it opens a new webpage. On this record page, the user can see the number of the result they are on (eg. Result 4) and toggle between results using the Previous/Next function. Instead of having to click the back button to return to the search results page, the user can simply select Back to results list. <a href="555hw1-screenshots.html">(See Screenshot)</a></p>

<h2><span style="color:green">O </span><h2>Ringling</h2> <p>This catalog opens outside links in new tabs so the user doesn’t have to click the back button to exit. When the user clicks on a record, it goes to a new webpage, but the user can easily return to the search results by clicking Results list.</p>
<br>

<h2> <span style="color:red">X </span>MFA</h2> <p>The language used on the record webpages is a little unclear, but the user can return to the search results by selecting Titles. There is also a Previous/Next function to sift through records. One rather inconvenient aspect is that the user cannot search again under the same location (Museum of Fine Arts) from the results page. If the user makes a search from the search bar on a results page, they must hit the search button to go to the search results, then adjust the necessary refinements using the filters on the right hand panel.</p>
